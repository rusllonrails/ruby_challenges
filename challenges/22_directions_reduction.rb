#
# 22: Directions Reduction
#
# BRIEF:
#
#   Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild west,â€¦
#   a man was given directions to go from one point to another.
#
#   The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST".
#   Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.
#
#   Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction is a needless effort.
#   Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water,
#   it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!
#
#   How I crossed the desert the smart way.
#   The directions given to the man are,
#
#   for example, the following (depending on the language):
#
#   ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
#
#   You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable,
#   better stay to the same place!
#
#   So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan.
#   A better plan in this case is simply:
#
#   ["WEST"]
#
#  TASK:
#
#    Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and
#    returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed
#    (W<->E or S<->N side by side).
